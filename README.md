#pps_project

Welcome to the pps_project repository!

For your first steps, I highly recommend you study and write down notes from the software carpentry tutorials. This will provide you the fluency required to navigate the terminal on your local machine and the cluster, as well as learning some python. I also highly recommend you navigate to cmelab/flowermd and go through the tutorials. From there, you'll have run some simulations of your own!

I recommend you work in this repository in the "flowermd" environment. All of the dependencies you'll need will be installed within that environment.
